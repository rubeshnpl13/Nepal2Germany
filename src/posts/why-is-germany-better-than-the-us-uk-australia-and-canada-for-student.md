If you're planning to study abroad from Nepal, youâ€™ve probably looked into popular countries like the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. But there's one destination that's quickly rising to the top of the list for smart students â€” Germany.

So why choose Germany over these English-speaking giants? Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. Free or Very Low Tuition Fees
Most public universities in Germany charge no tuition fees, even for international students. You only pay a small semester contribution (â‚¬100â€“â‚¬350), which often includes public transport.

Compare that to:

USA: $20,000â€“$50,000 per year

UK: Â£10,000â€“Â£30,000 per year

Australia: AUD 20,000â€“40,000 per year

Canada: CAD 15,000â€“30,000 per year

ðŸ‘‰ Verdict: Germany is far more affordable, especially for students from Nepal where currency conversion matters.
